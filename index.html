            This crockpot Buffalo chicken is great for hearty sandwiches that
            will please those who love Buffalo chicken wings. This recipe is
            perfect for those days spent watching football. I like to top these
            with blue cheese or ranch dressing.

            This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that
            makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted
            any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are
            having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.
